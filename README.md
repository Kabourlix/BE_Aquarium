# BE_Aquarium
 Ecosystem simulation for the C++ course at IMT Atlantique

# Getting started
    
## Compilation info

## How to launch ?
We have a few parameters to launch the simulation :
-  the amount of bestioles in the simulation
-  proportion of Gregaire (betw 0 & 1)
-  proportion of Kamikaze (betw 0 & 1)
-  proportion of Peureuse (betw 0 & 1)
-  proportion of Prevoyante (betw 0 & 1)
-  proportion of Multiple Personnalities (btw 0 & 1)
<color = "yellow">*Caution*</color>, the sum of all proportion must be exactly equal to one. Otherwise, an error is thrown and the program is stopped.
